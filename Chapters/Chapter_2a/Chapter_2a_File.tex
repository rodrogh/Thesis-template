\section{Introduction}

Previously, the bioinspired trend of mimicking the human skeletal muscle system, specifically the muscle-tendon component, in soft robotic for human assistance was identified. The available literature mainly focus on the muscle component. In line with the aims of this research, this chapter is focused on understanding the biomechanics of the human body, specifically of the lower limb due to the impact of this section of the body in the ADL. Therefore this chapter is divided as follows.
Section one focuses on understanding the terminology involved in the biomechanics of the human lower limb. In section two, many clinical trials, also known as gait analysis, are reviewed to characterize the parameters of torque, angle, and power of the human lower limb during ADL. Section three describes the muscle-tendon component from a mechanical perspective. Section four introduce many recent works and approaches which attempt to translate the functionality of the muscle-tendon component into soft robotic applications. Section five describes how recent works are addressing the lack of modelling tools for soft materials, considering two main modelling approaches: model-driven and data-driven. Finally, the last section presents a summary of the relevant findings of this chapter.

\section{Biomechanics of the Human Lower Limb}

The common terminology used in clinical trials for the lower limb make use of the three planes of action of the human body to name the motion of a given joint of the body. These three planes are called sagital, frontal and transverse (horizontal) \cite{PhysicalSolutions2016}. Along with the three planes come three axes used to identify specific motions: frontal horizontal axis, vertical axis and sagital horizontal axis. The positioning of each of them is illustrated in \autoref{fig:body_planes_axes}. The sagital plane divides the body vertically into left and right parts, the frontal plane divides the body vertically into front (posterior) and back (anterior) parts and the transverse plane divides the body horizontally into upper (superior) and lower (inferior) parts.

    \label{fig:body_planes_axes}
\end{figure}

Similarly, the motions of the human joints are named according to the plane and axis in which they are executed, which allows for easy recognition of certain motion (\autoref{fig:lower_motion}). There are ten different motions, grouped into five pairs, governing the lower limb of the body:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flexion and extension describes the bending motion which shortens, or increase the angle between two parts of the body, respectively.
    \item Abduction and adduction describes the motion away from, or towards the body midline, respectively.
    \item Eversion and inversion of the foot describe the motion away from, or towards the body midline, respectively.
    \item External rotation and internal rotation describe the motion away from, or towards the body midline, respectively.
    \item Horizontal abduction and adduction describes the motions away from, or towards the body midline, respectively.
\end{itemize}

\section{Characterization of Kinematic and Kinetic Parameters for Activities of Daily Living}
\label{sec:characterizationKKP}

The design process of a wearable robotic device includes the characterization of the kinematic and kinetic parameters (KKP) for the human joints intended to be assisted, which allows the device to be tailored to a particular application, whether assisting an elder adult or allowing a disable patient to walk. The effectiveness of each prototype is commonly assessed by measuring the metabolic cost reduction delivered to the user while performing an activity \cite{panizzolo2016biologically}. However, the latter requires specialized equipment. An alternative way is comparing the range of motion and torque delivered to the assisted joint with the values commonly found in humans during a certain activity. This type of data is available in gait analysis studies. The data from gait analyses can be used in the development of wearable robotic devices since it can provide design guidelines specific to the activity of interest, and can be also used to assess the degree of assistance provided by a prototype.

The KKP are usually found in clinical studies known as gait analyses. The kinematic parameters describe the human body motion in terms of the joint angle, velocity, and acceleration. The kinetic
parameters describe the forces causing this motion, e.g. joint torque and power. Motion capture is the most commonly used method to extract these parameters. However, other technologies such as soft strain sensors \cite{mengucc2014wearable}, electrogoniometers \cite{wu2011electromyography}, and inertial measurement units (IMU) have also been used. Lastly, it is important to mention that these studies differ between one another in many aspects, in addition to the technology of choice, such as subjects' gender, age, weight, etc., as well as the setup of the experiments.

This section is focused on describing the characterization process which, as previously mentioned, can be used as guidelines in the design of wearable robotic devices. The selected gait analyses in here cover the main activities of daily living (ADLs), which are: walking, ascending/descending stairs, ascending/descending ramps and chair standing up. Similarly, the data for the hip, knee and ankle joints is of interest. Finally, relevant information about the gait analyses and the characterization process is described in the following sections.

\subsection{Gait Analysis Data}

Gait Analysis studies provide the description of the performed experiment, including: the number of subjects in the group, subjects' characteristics such as age, weight, height, gender and health condition; experiment characteristics such as walking speed, ramp inclination, stairs geometry, initial sitting position and special conditions, such as, whether subjects are carrying a load or not. The subjects' characteristics are always presented in mean (average) values of the whole group. In a similar way, the derived data (torque and power) is presented in mean values and is normalized using the subjects' height, in the case of the gait cycle speed; and the subjects' weight, in the case of the torque of each joint. The normalization is appreciated in the units for torque and power, being Nm/kg and W/kg respectively. The data used in the normalization process is usually provided as mean values of the subjects' group's height and weight. However, in some studies like the one in \cite{lee2008biomechanics}, the gait cycle speed is not explicitly provided nor it can be calculated because the normalization process is done considering each subject's characteristics and not the mean values of the subjects group. 

From one study to another, the subjects group is expected to be different and diverse in several characteristics. This diversity causes segmentation of the whole group, e.g. in the study performed in \cite{bovi2011multiple}, there is a segmentation of the group in two different range of ages. One group included subjects from 22 to 72 years old, meanwhile, the subjects from the other group have ages ranged from 6 to 17 years old. The latter presented evidence of age-related differences which disproved the conclusions on previous works where these differences are non-existent. Nevertheless, when no significant difference is appreciated in the data despite the subjects' age diversity, the data is compiled into a single cluster and no segmentation is performed, such as the case in \cite{lee2008biomechanics}.

Motion capture technology allows the extraction of the kinematic parameters, such as the joint angle. Similarly, the kinetics of the human body are obtained using force plates which measure the ground reaction forces, a required parameter to calculate the joint torque and power. Therefore, the set of parameters usually found in gait analysis studies contains the joint angle, joint torque, and joint power. The activity gait cycle is usually presented in a chart accompanied with tables highlighting the maximum, minimum and mean values of the gait cycle. 

For the characterization of the human KKP, the differences between the maximum and minimum values of each parameter,i.e. its range, is of interest. Commonly, these values are provided in the studies in the form of tables and charts \cite{han2011biomechanical,yali2010biomechanics}. It could also be the case where the whole experiment dataset is provided \cite{moore2015elaborate}. When a data table is available, the extraction of the values is straight forward. Nevertheless, cases such as \cite{protopapadaki2007hip,riener2002stair,mcintosh2006gait,roebroeck1994biomechanics,mak2003joint} do not provide any table and the data have to be extracted visually, adding some error to the process and decreasing the data reliability. Likewise, it can be the case for some studies to focus on specific features of the gait cycle, such as maximum and minimum values of each parameter; or not provide one or more of the parameters of interest (angle, torque or power).

\subsection{Extracting Design Guidelines}

The variations of the data from one experiment to another can be reduced by focusing on the range obtained from the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each parameter. This is illustrated in \autoref{fig:HipKKPWalking}, despite the variations between the maximum and minimum values from one experiment to another, the actual range of each parameter is similar among all the experiments. The mean range of motion for the hip joint angle throughout different walking over-ground experiments was found to be 44.63\degree{} (\autoref{fig:HipKKPWalking}). Also, the greatest variation between the mean range value and the range value of each experiment is 18\% of the mean value. The previous calculation can be used to decide design parameters of wearable robotic devices, such as which range of motion should be covered by the device depending on which sector of the population is intended to be assisted. Alternatively, the device can be tailored to cover as much of the population as possible by choosing the maximum and minimum values of the range of motion, out of all the experiments.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Visualization of gait analyses data using clustered-stacked bar charts. }
    \label{fig:clusteredMain}
\end{figure}

Different design guidelines can be extracted when visually analyzing other parameters together. For example, in \autoref{fig:KneeKKPWalking} , the parameters of the knee joint are now compared against many experiments of stairs ascending/descending. Now, the main feature is not the range of motion of the knee, but the characteristics of the torque values. They appeared mirrored, in other words, the torque values required for descending stairs are of similar in magnitude but opposite in direction. Also, the amount required for ascending stairs is generally twice as much as the amount required for descending stairs. The latter illustrates an optimization opportunity. When designing a wearable robotic device for human for human assistance, the actuator is chosen to satisfy a certain torque range of a particular activity. Without the characterization of the parameters performed, the actuator is most likely to be oversized to comply with the most demanding part of the activity. However, a different approach could be proposed: agonist-antagonist actuators; a technique implemented in several wearable robotic devices which at the same time complies with the actual functionality of the human skeletal muscle system.

Another useful way of extracting design guidelines from the gait analyses is to plot the range of a specific parameter against different ADL. At the best of our knowledge, this approach has only been documented once in \cite{rowe2000knee}, where the range of motion of the knee joint is compiled into a chart for 11 different ADL. This concept, illustrated in \autoref{fig:HipTorqueRange}, can provide insight of two important design parameters. On the one hand, the actuators meant for this application must be able to deliver torques in both directions of rotation, i.e. clockwise and anti-clockwise. On the other hand, the selected actuation technology must meat the torque requirements, specified in the \autoref{fig:HipTorqueRange}, of the activity or activities of interest. \autoref{fig:HipTorqueRange} was constructed using the mean range of the hip joint torque during different activities \cite{bovi2011multiple,lee2008biomechanics,han2011biomechanical,protopapadaki2007hip,riener2002stair,mcintosh2006gait,roebroeck1994biomechanics,mak2003joint}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{HipTorqueRange.png}
    \caption{Illustration of the range values of the torque during several activities. The values for the maximum and minimum torque are mean values obtained by averaging the data of all the different gait analysis experiments enclosed in one main activity. \cite{bovi2011multiple,lee2008biomechanics,han2011biomechanical,protopapadaki2007hip,riener2002stair,mcintosh2006gait,roebroeck1994biomechanics,mak2003joint} }
    \label{fig:HipTorqueRange}
\end{figure}

Another alternative of visual representation of the data can be done by grouping the range of a specific parameter and comparing it with any of the subjects' physical characteristics, e.g. the age range. This is illustrated in \autoref{fig:KneeRangeAge}, where the dependency of the subjects' age with the knee range of motion is evidenced. The colour code used in \autoref{fig:KneeRangeAge}, the age ranges and knee ranges of motion are presented in \autoref{tbl:KneeRangeMotionage}. The chart shown in \autoref{fig:KneeRangeAge} concentrates the data from three different gait analyses, in which six age groups are contained. The approach used in \autoref{fig:KneeRangeAge} is to overlap areas of different colours, each area represents the range of motion of the knee for a specific age range. The area in which several areas intersect can be appreciated due to the enabled transparency property. Nevertheless, the areas where three and two areas are intersected are manually highlighted by a surrounding solid line and dotted line respectively, to improve their visualization. This simple intersection of areas can provide information regarding the required range of motion to be delivered by the wearable robotic device, depending the sector of the population focused on.
For example, if a wearable robotic device was aiming to assist the population sector aged from 50 to 70 years old, then a range of motion of the knee joint from 5 to 63 would be enough to cover the mentioned population. The later range of motion is taken from the triple intersection of areas illustrated in \autoref{fig:KneeRangeAge}, which can provide a certain degree of confidence since three different clinical studies were compared. This approach can be used to compare other characteristics, e.g. subject's weight against torque. Summarizing, the areas overlapping approach can provide guidelines to avoid oversizing of the wearable robotic device to be developed by analysing the intersection of different areas which ultimately provides a degree of confidence when deciding design parameters.

In this section the process of characterizing the human lower limb kinematics and kinetics parameters during some ADLs, was described. The relevant information provided in gait analysis experiments was described, as well as possible challenges when extracting it. Data compiled for the activities of walking, ascending/descending stairs, ascending/descending ramps and chair standing up were presented in the form of clustered stacked bar charts. This type of chart allowed quick and easy detection of similarities between several clinical trials of the same activity. In contrast, the spotted differences, as the ones for the knee torque values during ascending/descending stairs, are indicators for optimization opportunities where instead of using a single actuator to satisfy the torque range, an agonist-antagonist system could be more suitable.

The reliability of the data can also be observed using the type chart of overlapping areas with subjects' age ranges against the knee ranges of motion. In other words, the specific ranges in which the data from different experiments overlaps, gives a measure of consistency which can be used to tailor the developed wearable device coverage. 

The chart style with ranges of motion versus activities, facilitates the choice of the actuator type and dimension (depending on the activities of interest). The styles used to represent the charts was kept as simple as possible while providing useful information about the KKP. However, more complex plotting methods can be used. Finally, a total of 12 charts were produced in Excel\textregistered{} using the compiled data from the gait analyses. In favour of keeping the length of this section adequate, only two out of the 12 charts were included in here. The remainder charts were moved to the \autoref{appendixA}.

\section{The Muscle-tendon Component} \label{sec:muscle_tendon}

Having defined the terminology involved in the biomechanics of the human skeletal muscle system, and characterized the kinetic and kinematic parameters of its lower limb, this section now focus on describing the muscle-tendon component from a mechanical point of view. 

In the literature, the mechanical model commonly used to describe the mechanical behaviour of the muscle-tendon component is the Hill's model \cite{hill1938heat}. This model is considered to be the most representative of all \cite{zhang2012sma}. Hill’s model describes the skeletal muscle as a three elements system, which contains a contractile element, a passive element, and a series element. The contractile element (CE) represent the muscle fibres in charge generating the contractile forces, the parallel element (PE) is formed by the tissue surrounding the muscle which prevents it from overstretching, and the series element (SE) represents the human tendon, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:hillModel}.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{HillModel.png}
    \caption{Hill's model of the skeletal muscle. The contractile element (CE), the parallel element (PE) and the series element (SE) are shown \cite{hill1938heat} }
    \label{fig:hillModel}
\end{figure}

Hill's model makes the important assumption of considering the SE to be purely elastic, i.e. the deformation of the element is entirely dependent to the force applied to it. Nevertheless, the non-linear viscoelastic properties of the human tendon are acknowledged in his work. The latter simplification is a common practice among studies of the skeletal muscle system because the muscle and tendon are studied as a whole (muscle-tendon component) \cite{zajac1989muscle}. Evidence of the actual benefits of this simplification is found in the literature for the field of robotics exoskeletons. The complex muscle-tendon model developed in \cite{lloyd2003emg}, considered the viscoelastic properties of the human tendon to estimate forces and joint torques in real time. The model achieved high accuracy at the cost of high computational load. In an attempt to reduce the computational load, the assumption of an infinitely stiff tendon was made which proved to be reliable as well \cite{sartori2009stiff}.

In a similar way, developments in the field of soft robotics which are inspired in the skeletal muscle system functionality are also based in Hill's model, as highlighted in SECTION. Commonly, springs [13] or Bowden cables [44] are implemented as the SE of the muscle-tendon model. Nevertheless, the fact is that the human tendon has viscoelastic properties [76]. At the time of starting this research, the documented works in the literature were mainly focused on developing and testing soft materials to be used as the contractile element in a soft artificial muscles. The latter, previously identified as a research opportunity, indicates that the viscoelastic properties of soft materials have not been studied with the aim of developing a soft artificial tendon, which in combination with current soft artificial muscle could deliver better performance is soft robotic applications for human assistance.

The first step towards the investigation on the potential benefits of adding viscoelasticity, in the form of a soft SE, to soft actuators is described as follows. As a starting point,the mechanical properties of the human tendon must be investigated. Due to the large contribution of the knee joint in the ADL, we have focused our investigation in this joint of the human lower limb. Subsequently, the selection and characterization of many soft materials with mechanical properties similar to the human tendon, is proposed. The extracted properties from the soft studied soft materials and from the human tendon are compared against each other. This comparison analysis has the potential of providing evidence on the benefits and disadvantages of implementing a viscoelastic element as the way to transmit tensile forces in soft orthoses and soft exosuits.

\subsection{Viscoelasticity of the Human Tendon and Soft Materials}

Tendons are connective tissue that links muscles with bones. As previously mentioned, the human tendon has a non-linear viscoelastic behaviour. This means that the deformation experienced by the material when a force is applied to it, is not proportional to the force through the whole range of possible deformations, and also that it is dependent on the history of previous deformations. At rest, the collagen fibres (core components of tendons) are in a relaxed wavy state. When the tendon experiences a tensile force, the collagen fibres are easily stretched and realigned, opposing little resistance to deformation. However, when the collagen fibres are completely stretched they begin to offer more resistance to deformation which is proportional to the applied force. Finally, fibres can be stretched to their limit and failure of the tendon will occur \cite{nordin2001basic}. This non-linear response to the applied deformation is better explained in \autoref{fig:tendonSS} where the characteristic S-shape curve for tendon stress-strain graphs is appreciated.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{TendonStressStrain.png}
    \caption{Tendon stress-strain curve. The toe region represents the interval where collagen fibres offer little resistance to deformation. The linear elastic region is when collagen fibres are stretched and start offering a linear behaviour. From the slope of this region, the Young's modulus can be extracted. The yield point is represented by the applied stress which cause plastic deformations on the tendon. Failure occurs beyond this point, where stress abruptly goes down as deformation continues. Image adapted from \cite{maurel1998biomechanical}. }
    \label{fig:tendonSS}
\end{figure}

The stress-strain curve in \autoref{fig:tendonSS} illustrates the mechanical properties of a human tendon. The stress is described as the tensile force per cross-sectional unit area experienced by the tendon. This stress causes the tendon to elongate (deform). In the chart, the elongation is represented as the strain, which is the tendon deformation as a percentage of its original length. Along with the stress-strain curve, the force-elongation curve is also used to visualize the mechanical properties of tendons. These experiments are performed in a static state, i.e. the strain rate is the same throughout the whole experiment. Therefore, they do not provide any information about the viscoelastic properties of the tendon.

Viscoelastic materials exhibit both elastic and viscous characteristic. Viscosity describes a fluid's resistance to flow, the more viscous a fluid is, the more slowly will flow and vice versa. The latter suggest a time-dependent behaviour. In the case of viscoelastic materials, this time-dependent behaviour is shown when subjecting the material to different rates of strain or deformation. For example, the stress-strain curve of the human tendon, illustrated in \autoref{fig:tendonSS}, would have a greater slope in the elastic region if a greater strain rate is applied. The viscoelastic behaviour of the human tendon can be analysed with the following mechanical tests: stress relaxation, creep (deformation over time) and hysteresis \cite{nordin2001basic}.

During the stress relaxation experiment, the tendon is subjected to a constant deformation (length remains the same throughout the whole experiment). To avoid plastic deformations, i.e. incorrect measurements, the parameter of deformation for this experiment must not exceed the linear region of the material. The initial force/stress triggered as a response of the applied deformation will decrease over time (relax) until reaching equilibrium. From this experiment a chart of force against time is generated (\autoref{fig:tendonSR_Creep}). In a similar way, in the creep experiment a constant force, avoiding plastic deformations, is applied to the material. The material will creep as time pass, in other words, the deformation caused by the applied force will increase over time until reaching equilibrium. A chart of deformation against time is generated (\autoref{fig:tendonSR_Creep}). Finally, during the hysteresis experiment the tendon is subjected to cyclic tests where a load is applied up to a certain stress level and then released (unloading). The tendon behaviour shows two different paths, one for loading and one for unloading. Due to the time-dependent behaviour of viscoelastic materials, each cycle will generate different load-unload paths since the time interval for each cycle to be executed are intentionally defined to prevent the material of reaching equilibrium (\autoref{fig:tendonHysteresis}).

\begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{TendonSR&Creep.png}
    \caption{Tendon curves for the experiments of stress relaxation (left) and creep (right). During the stress relaxation experiment, the tendon is subjected to a constant stress, causing an initial deformation in the tendon which will decrease over time at a certain rate until reaching equilibrium. In the case of the creep experiment, the tendon subjected to a constant deformation, causing an initial stress response which will decrease over time at a certain rate until reaching equilibrium. The experiments were executed several times under the same conditions, the curve labelled  illustrates the tendon reaching a steady state where repeatability between experiments is achieved. This effect is explained in next paragraph. Image reproduced from \cite{maurel1998biomechanical} }
    \label{fig:tendonSR_Creep}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb!]

    \caption{Hysteresis of the human tendon. The chart on the left shows both loading and unloading paths for few cycles, whereas the chart on the right shows 200 loading-unloading cycles. The hysteresis of the tendon, i.e. the area under the curve, is smaller for each new cycle. The preconditioned state of the tendon is reached for cycles above 50, i.e. stop changing. Left and right images taken from \cite{maurel1998biomechanical,schatzmann1998effect} respectively. }
    \label{fig:tendonHysteresis}
\end{figure}

When performing mechanical experiments to find the tendon properties at failure, the obtained results are different between a preconditioned and an unconditioned tendon, as proved in \cite{schatzmann1998effect}. This effect is illustrated in \autoref{fig:tendonSR_Creep} as well, for both experiments, the tendon relaxation and creep are smaller for each new testing cycle until reaching an equilibrium state, i.e. the preconditioning state. The previous set of experiments is useful to characterize the non-linear viscoelastic properties of tendons and soft materials. Therefore, to perform the comparison analysis mentioned in \autoref{sec:muscle_tendon}, the soft materials of interest must be characterized using some of these mechanical tests. The study of the creep and hysteresis is out of the scope of this research. Instead, the tensile strength and stress relaxation is analysed. The selection criteria for the synthetic soft materials to be used is explained in next section.

\section{Soft Materials to Match the Properties of the Human Tendon}

The selection of the soft material to be implemented was based on the literature about tendon reconstruction applications. A comprehensive review about the usage of synthetic materials in tendon reconstruction is made by A. Shalimar in \cite{abdullah2015usage}, where the most common materials used as artificial tendons and for tendon reconstruction, are reported as: carbon, polyethylene terephthalate (polyester), polytetrafluoroethylene, among others. The latter suggest that polymers are highly compatible with the human skeletal system and have similar mechanical properties as the human tendon. This assumption is further verified in the study performed by S. Duenwald et al. in \cite{duenwald2009viscoelastic}, which is about the viscoelastic relaxation and recovery of the human tendon. In this work, the high density polyethylene was tested to find great similarities between this material and the mechanical properties of the human tendon. In fact, the viscoelastic properties of the human tendon during loading and unloading are similar to the ones found in polyethylene. However, high density polyethylene is not able to sustain high strains without suffering plastic deformations nor it has a very fast elastic response.
Among the current developments in soft orthoses, silicone rubber is a common choice, due to its high compliance, high elasticity and softness. Silicone rubber is usually implemented to create inflatable elements, but it is also known to have non-linear elastic properties, as reported in \cite{roylance2008mechanical}. 

These findings suggest that the limitations of polymers, in terms of its elasticity, could be circumvented when combined them with elastomers, such as rubber. A material with the latter characteristics, is known as a composite materials. Many composite materials are created by injecting polymer particles, such as the previously mentioned polyethylene, into a rubber mixture. Thanks to the advances in manufacturing of composite materials, there is a wide variety of commercially available materials that fit with the requirements of this research. Due to the latter information, the selection of the soft materials to be studied in this work are from the family of composite materials, as follows: Polyethylene Rubber, Ethylene Polypropylene, Natural Rubber with Polyester, Natural Rubber, Silicone Rubber, Fluorocarbon Rubber, Nitrile Rubber. Finally, the characterization process is described in chapter \autoref{ch:characterizationSoft}.

\section{Modelling Techniques for Soft Materials}

In the previous section, an important challenge in the development of soft robotic applications for human assistance was highlighted, which is the lack of reliable modelling techniques to accurately describe the mechanical behaviour of soft materials implemented as part of new soft actuation technologies. Most of the documented soft robotic applications use soft materials from the family of thermoplastic elastomers (TPE). These type of materials are known to have a non-linear stress response, low stiffness, high deformation lengths, and a time-dependent and temperature-dependent response \cite{Bauman2008}. These mechanical properties are similar to the ones found in biological skin or muscle tissue, which is why soft materials are being implemented in soft robotic applications, despite of the many challenges. However, it is imperative to have a reliable modelling technique to fully take advantage of the latter mechanical properties. This is identified as a research opportunity and is the main focus of this research.

This section presents a summary of the most commonly used modelling techniques, their limitations and current direction of this research field. The range of modelling techniques used to describe the mechanical properties of soft materials can be categorized as: model-driven and data-driven approaches. As the name suggest, model-driven approaches are based on mathematical models, whereas data-driven approaches are based on computational methods. These approaches are described in detail in the following subsections.



\subsection{Model-driven Approaches}

what is the main reason of this section:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce the commonly used model-driven approaches in soft robotic applications
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This require a small literature review of actual soft robotic applications for human assistance which use model-driven approaches.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Direct the focus into the Linear Viscoelastic Models, but mention other mathematical models with high accuracy and very expensive computational cost
\end{itemize}

In the field of soft robotics, most of the model-driven approaches used in physical applications are focused on modelling the viscoelastic mechanical properties, i.e. the material stress response when being deformed.

\section{The Human Musculoskeletal System}

\subsection{Muscle Redundancy}

What does redundancy refer to?

Studies on the ``redundancy" of the human musculoskeletal system and the problematic on how the brain addresses the control of an ``overcomplete" system date back to the 1950s. In mechanical systems, redundancy refers to having more than two linear actuators controlling a single degree of freedom (DOF). In robotics applications, the common choice is to use a single rotational actuator,  or few linear actuators, per degree of freedom (DOF). The hypothesis of the human musculoskeletal system being redundant, i.e. many muscles, only able to contract, controls one DOF, is valid from a strictly mechanical point of view. G. Loeb explains why this hypothesis is biased to the results obtained from restrictive experimentation where subjects are asked to perform ``simple" movements, such as ankle dorsiflexion. These experiments often overlook the understanding of subjects about the task to be performed, which leads to a great variability of muscles activation for the same task depending on the subject intention. The latter means that more muscles than expected are potentially involved in the control of  a single DOF \cite{loeb2000overcomplete}.

Why are anthropomorphic systems redundant?

However, G. Loeb disproves the existence of redundancy in the human musculoskeletal system by simple calculating the required number of muscles (two per DOF) to control a human limb with N DOF. In his work, it is mentioned that less muscles than the minimum required amount of 2*N intervene in the motion of a specific human limb, suggesting that the human musculoskeletal system might be incomplete (underactuated) rather than overcomplete. In reality, the human musculoskeletal system may have barely enough muscles to perform the wide range of activities involved in a real-life environment. The latter is strongly supported in the recent work of A. Marjaninejad \etal in where a systematical analysis regarding the redundancy of anthropomorphic systems is performed CITE. 

What are the benefits of redundancy?
