\chapter{Soft Materials Modelling: Linear Viscoelastic Models} \label{sec:ModellingLVM}

%NOTE: This paper is a good literature for the next chapter about modeling, "Soft Material Characterization for Robotic Applications". In here there is a section about the variability of the materials properties from one batch to the other. However there is a consistency from specimens from the same batch
