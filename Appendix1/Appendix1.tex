\chapter{Characterization of the Human Body Lower Limb} \label{appendixA}
This appendix presents the reviewed clinical studies for four main human activities of daily living: walking, ascending/descending steps, ascending/descending ramps and sitting down/standing up from chair. The compilation of data was performed to characterize the relevant parameters for the motion of human lower limb. From the clinical trials it was taken the angle, torque and power of each joint for the lower limb, i.e. hip, knee and ankle. Subsequently, the data was compiled into a table and then into several charts which focused on representing the range of motion of each joint during each activity.
